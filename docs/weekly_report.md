## üßæ Weekly Progress Report

### ‚úÖ Summary of Progress
| Member | Work Completed |
|---------|----------------|
| **Harshil (Dataset & Evaluation Lead)** | ‚Ä¢ Completed dataset setup for **HRSC2016** and **DOTA** (train/val/test splits).<br>‚Ä¢ Began integrating evaluation metrics (**IoU**, **mAP**) for horizontal and rotated boxes. |
| **Ashar (Baseline Detector Lead)** | ‚Ä¢ Trained and validated **YOLOv5** baseline model on two dataset splits.<br>‚Ä¢ Collected and documented baseline results (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix). |
| **Ryan (RoI Transformation Lead)** | ‚Ä¢ Set up Google Colab environment with all dependencies (PyTorch, Ultralytics, OpenCV, Pandas, etc.).<br>‚Ä¢ Implemented dataset consistency checks and conversion scripts (HRSC XML ‚Üí YOLO, DOTA TXT ‚Üí YOLO).<br>‚Ä¢ Structured YOLO directories and generated configuration files (`.yaml`).<br>‚Ä¢ Launched baseline **YOLOv5** training on HRSC and DOTA.<br>‚Ä¢ Clarified dataset preprocessing: normalization of bounding boxes removes the need for manual resizing, as YOLO automatically handles image scaling during training. |
| **Sassan (Feature Extraction & Report Lead)** | ‚Ä¢ Structured the **project report in LaTeX**, drafting full *Introduction* and *Methodology* sections.<br>‚Ä¢ Incorporated clarification on YOLO‚Äôs coordinate normalization in the Methodology section.<br>‚Ä¢ Prepared a plan for **feature extraction analysis** (HOG and CNN embeddings) to compare **HBB vs. RRoI** detections once rotation outputs are ready. |

## üí¨ Meeting Notes
- Confirmed **HRSC2016** as the primary dataset for baseline and rotation testing.  
- Discussed finalizing baseline detector training before implementing the **RoI Transformation** module.  
- Clarified that **manual resizing** of images is unnecessary since YOLO normalizes coordinates and automatically resizes input images at runtime.  
- Outlined the next steps for rotation-aware detection, feature analysis, and report progress tracking.

## üîÆ Week 8 Plan

### üéØ Group Goals
- Finalize **YOLO baseline results** (mAP, IoU, precision‚Äìrecall).  
- Implement and test **RoI Transformation** using `cv2.minAreaRect` and `cv2.boxPoints`.  
- Begin **feature extraction and visualization** workflow for HBB outputs.  
- Continue report development (Results & Discussion section outline).  

### üë• Member Tasks
| Member | Next Steps |
|---------|------------|
| **Harshil** | ‚Ä¢ Complete evaluation metrics for rotated bounding boxes.<br>‚Ä¢ Generate plots for precision‚Äìrecall and mAP comparisons. |
| **Ashar** | ‚Ä¢ Finalize YOLOv5 training across all dataset splits.<br>‚Ä¢ Export trained model weights and inference samples for RRoI testing. |
| **Ryan** | ‚Ä¢ Implement and test **HBB‚ÜíRRoI conversion** using OpenCV geometry methods.<br>‚Ä¢ Visualize and validate rotated bounding boxes on HRSC images. |
| **Sassan** | ‚Ä¢ Begin **feature extraction** from baseline YOLO detections (HOG and CNN embeddings).<br>‚Ä¢ Create visualizations (PCA/t-SNE) to assess class clustering.<br>‚Ä¢ Extend **LaTeX report** with *Results & Discussion* section framework. |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Notes
- Large dataset size (~8 GB) may increase training time on limited GPU resources.  
- Team should maintain consistent file and label naming to ensure smooth integration between YOLO outputs and RoI transformation scripts.  
- Rotation-based training may require additional validation to avoid coordinate misalignment errors.

## üì¶ Deliverables for Week 8 Meeting
1. Final YOLOv5 baseline metrics (accuracy, mAP, precision/recall).  
2. Initial **RoI Transformation** visual samples (rotated bounding boxes).  
3. Early **feature extraction notebook** comparing HBB feature representations.  
4. Updated LaTeX report (Introduction, Methodology, Results structure).
