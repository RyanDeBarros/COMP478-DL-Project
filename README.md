👥 Team Members & Roles

Person A (Dataset & Evaluation Lead) – prepares datasets, splits, and evaluation metrics (IoU, mAP).

Person B (Baseline Detector Lead) – sets up baseline object detector (YOLO / Faster R-CNN / Light-Head R-CNN).

Person C (RoI Transformation Lead) – implements horizontal-to-rotated bounding box conversion and visualization.

Person D (Feature Extraction & Report Lead) – experiments on rotation-invariant features (HOG / CNN), creates plots & leads report writing.
